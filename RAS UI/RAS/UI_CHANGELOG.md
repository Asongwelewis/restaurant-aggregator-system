## 1. New Screens & Features Implemented
- **Guest User Experience:**
  - Added `GuestMapListScreen` for guests to browse nearby restaurants with filters and info modal.
- **Registered User Experience:**
  - Added `RecommendationsSection` to `HomeScreen` for personalized restaurant suggestions.
  - Created `AdvancedBookingScreen` for advanced booking with filters and real-time availability.
- **Restaurant Owner Experience:**
  - Added `AdCampaignsScreen` for managing restaurant ad campaigns.

- **Super Admin Experience:**
  - Created `SuperAdminPanel` for system management, account management, ad pricing, and system health.
  - Added Super Admin as an account type in both the account switcher and the initial account type selection screen (`ChooseAccountTypeScreen`).

---

## 2. Navigation & Account Switching
- Registered all new screens in `App.js` and navigation stacks.
- Updated the account switcher in `HomeScreen` to allow switching between user, restaurant, and super admin roles.
- Added Super Admin as an option in `ChooseAccountTypeScreen` with a unique icon and color.

---

## 3. UI/UX Improvements
- Ensured UI/UX parity and feature completeness for all user types (guest, user, restaurant owner, super admin).
- Updated `UserProfileScreen` to handle missing user data gracefully.
- Enhanced booking and reservation screens for better detail and usability.
- All new features/screens use mock data and are ready for backend integration.

---

## 4. Project Structure & Portability
- Ensured all assets and imports use relative paths.
- No OS-specific or absolute paths in code.
- All context and navigation logic is modular and portable.
- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` are set up to avoid committing build artifacts or system files.

---

## 5. Dependency & Compatibility Review
- All dependencies in `package.json` are compatible with Expo SDK 53.
- **Recommendation:** Remove `react-scripts` from dependencies (not needed for Expo).
- **Recommendation:** Use only one lock file (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) to avoid install conflicts.

---

## 6. How to Run the UI Anywhere
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` (use only one, not both).
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm start` (which runs `expo start`).
4. Use Expo Go or an emulator to preview.
